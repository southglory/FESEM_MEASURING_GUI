# FESEM_MEASURING_GUI

MY_WID_UP_9_10 .version series are the latest version GUI.
This GUI were developed by me for the use of measuring distance in FE-SEM(Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope) Image.
Program is based on py qt library, and openCV for image processing. GUI(graphic user interface) made with qyqt includes those below.

1. Image  load&save.

2. Paint or draw geometric shapes like "line", or "Triangle".

3. Automatic recognition of the size(pixel) of scalebar in FE-SEM image, and calculate scale(=micrometer/pixel).

4. Convert the size(pixel) of drawn geometric shapes to the real size(micrometer).

5. Calculate angles of drawn "triangle", and classify them to certain standard(ASTM guide for pit corrosion research which is engaged in my research area, Mechanical Engineering) 

6. Automatic saving of results in excel files and image files.
